# GitHub Issue Preparation

When the user asks to prepare, draft, or refine a GitHub issue:

- Always write the issue **in English**.
- Keep the wording **very specific and concise**.
- Return the **issue wrapped in a single code fence with markdown tag** in **markdown raw format**.
- Do not include any text before or after the fenced markdown block; only output the issue body inside the code fence.
- At the very top of the fenced markdown block, include a line suggesting an issue title in the form: Title: [short, concise title] (before ### Description).
- Use **exactly** this template and keep the section headings unchanged:

### Description
[Explain what needs to be done in this task, relevant context, the value/impact it adds, and any dependencies or blockers with other tasks.]

### Scope
[Define what is included in this task and what is explicitly out of scope. Clarify any boundaries, assumptions, or constraints that affect the work.]

### Acceptance Criteria
[Specific, measurable outcome or deliverable.]
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Requirement 3

### Additional Notes
[Implementation considerations, technical details, design references, or any other resources needed to complete the task.]
